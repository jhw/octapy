You are in a Python gist in which we are trying to reverse engineer the binary file format used by the Elektron Octatrack Mark II. The Octatrack is connected at /Volumes/OCTATRACK/Woldo, with Woldo the set name. I've created a clean project called CLEAN TEMPLATE with no modifications. I'm going to create some other projects with modifications. I'll tell you those project names are and what the modifications are. Your job is to identify what's changed by comparing the modified project files to the files in the unmodified one, and document those changes. Based on your documentation, we're going to ultimately, build a python us to read and write octatrack projects. How to look at the existing documentation which describes what we know so far about the structure. Note that in general I will index tracks, patterns and projects from index 1 as the machine UI does, but under the hood they may be indexed off zero, although I understand the format does not do this uniformly. Note also that the documentation contains references to other projects in this space, and they may contain useful data which can help us.
